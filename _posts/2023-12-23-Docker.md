## What is Docker?
From Docker: "Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly."

In short, Docker is a platform to enable quick delivery of software irrespective of the platform.

## What are containers?
Docker containers are like a "package" or "bundle" of everything that an application needs to run eg application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies and configuration files. It is portable and makes the development and deployment easy and efficient

A container is a collection of different images of applications and dependencies used to run an application.

A collection of different images is a Docker Image and a container is an instance of the docker image, which is created when a DOcker image is run, which allows to run the application.
